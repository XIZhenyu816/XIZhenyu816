# About me ðŸ‘‹

**XIZhenyu816/XIZhenyu816** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently working on E-Drive system development and have more than 10 years' work experience on Electric Vehicle Battery system and E-Drive system, now focus on the real time simulation of different controller on the vehicle and other application.
- ðŸ‘¯ I would like to collabrate with anyone who have experience on the real time simulation for different controllers and share the knowledge and experience.
- ðŸ¤” Also need to mentioned is I still need to leran more on this subject as the transfer from the controller to the plant model still need some time.
